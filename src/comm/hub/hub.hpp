/**
* @file hub.hpp
*
* @brief Defines the `etask::comm::hub` class for managing multiple communication interfaces.
*
* @ingroup etask_comm etask::comm
* 
* This file declares the `etask::comm::hub` template class, which acts as a central communication manager
* that enables simultaneous operation of multiple communication interfaces (e.g., serial, Wi-Fi, etc.)
*
* (Imagine it as the USB hub of your computer where you can plug a mouse, keyboard, headphones into it and than connect the other end to a single 
* port on your computer. The hub will then manage the communication with all of them)
* 
* The `hub` class provides runtime control over which interfaces are active for sending and receiving packets,
* using a lightweight compile-time-indexed bitset called `typeset`. The class supports dynamically enabling or disabling
* each interface's participation in send and receive operations.
*
* All interfaces must conform to a common interface API, providing `send(const Packet&)` and `try_receive()` methods.
* 
* @note To simplify usage with common defaults (all interfaces enabled for send/receive by default),
*       prefer using the helper function `make_hub()`, which deduces template arguments and enables both
*       sending and receiving on all provided interfaces.
* 
* @example Example usage:
* @code
* etask::comm::hub<my_packet, my_interface> hub;
*
* my_packet_t p = ...;
* hub.send(p); // Send via all interfaces
* auto maybe = hub.try_receive(); // Try receive from any active receiver
* @endcode
