* @brief Internal utilities and metaprogramming facilities for the etask library.
*
* @defgroup etask_internal etask::internal
*
* This file serves as the **umbrella include** for all internal components
* of the etask framework. It collects commonly used metaprogramming tools,
* traits, type containers, and compile-time utilities that enable the
* advanced generic mechanisms throughout the library.
*
* These internal tools are primarily intended for the libraryâ€™s own
* infrastructure. However, advanced users may include this header for
* custom extensions or sophisticated metaprogramming tasks.
*
* @note This file is purely a convenience include and introduces no additional symbols.
