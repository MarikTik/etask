Hub â€” fan-out (send) / fan-in (receive) manager over multiple async Interfaces.

- Assumes every interface derives from `comm.interfaces.Interface`.
- Sends run concurrently across all enabled sender interfaces.
- Receives race all enabled receiver interfaces and return the first valid packet.
- No timeouts here; cancellations control lifetime (like other components).

    Manage multiple communication interfaces as a single endpoint.

    Responsibilities
    ----------------
    - Lifecycle helpers: `open_all()`, `close_all()`.
    - Enable/disable each interface for sending/receiving at runtime.
    - Send a packet across all enabled senders (concurrently).
    - Try to receive one packet from any enabled receiver (first to complete & validate wins).

    Notes
    -----
    - All interfaces *must* be instances of `Interface` (your ABC). This guarantees
      consistent validator/sealing behavior and unified `try_receive`.
    - `try_receive` simply passes (packet type, size/uid_type, policy) through to each interface's
      `try_receive`. Validation and board filtering are handled inside each interface.
